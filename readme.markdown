Norman
========

### In few words
Norman is a _convention validation framework_ for .NET

It works with NUnit, XUnit.NET, and MsTest.

Currently it's in very early stages of development so features as well as API are in flux and change daily.
For that reason documentation at the moment is non-existing too. This will change at the project leaves exploratory phase.
